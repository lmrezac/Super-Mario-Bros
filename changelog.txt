+Added new texture packs: Custom, SMB3, SMB Special
+Changed sprite & image mechanics:
	+There is now only one ImageIcon for every different theme
		-this is achieved through use of MultiIcon object.
	+Most tiles can be animated by just putting frames below each other 
	   in the image file
	+There are separate folders for different level themes (dark, light, castle,etc.)
	+Most non-tile sprites use sprite maps instead of separate files for animation.
	+Most non-tile sprites use universal "theme palettes" for different level themes.
		-these palettes are stored in a named palette .png file
			-a palette is a ? width x 2 height png file where the 
			  top row contains light variants of colors and the
			  bottom row contains the changed versions 
	+Pipes also now use the palette system
+Texture Pack system now uses SMB1 images if none can be found for new texture pack
+Texture Pack system now is easier for me to add new texture packs. 
	-you will never need to modify the TexturePack.class file again
-Removed a bunch of now-unnecessary image files
-Removed different theme variants of the same block and/or sprite
	-they now automatically change, both in the game and in the editor
+Ground now has different textures based on adjoining blocks
	-this allows for custom texture packs to add stuff like the grass from SMW.
	-same goes for cloud ground
	-this cannot be seen in default SMB1 texture pack
+Added Ghost House SMB1 theme from Super Mario Maker
+Added a bunch of new textures for alternate themes.
+Added some cheatcodes:
	-one that turns the whole game into Super Luigi Bros, which mirrors the screen 
	  horizontally.
	-one that switches between mario and luigi
+Added a water background override for water levels
	-it's optional, just either include the image file or don't
+Sky colors and water colors can be changed by texture packs
	-this is decided by a 1x1 pixel .png file for that color
-Broke all new texturepacks due to the new image & sprite mechanics :(
+When changing themes in the editor, the actual button images change to their
   alternate versions corresponding to that theme
-Removed the game loading splash screen unintentionally when decompiling original jar

Play around with the game to find any other changes I might have missed
